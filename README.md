This is a simple remote for the [M5Stack Cardputer](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stack-cardputer-kit-w-m5stamps3) to control two LEGO trains with one device. One LEGO train should be a newer [Powered Up hub](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/hub-88009) train (BT) and the other LEGO train should be an older [Power Functions](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-power-functions-ir-receiver-8884) train (IR). It makes sense for the trains I own. :) The remote is able to control the speed of both channels/ports of the BT and IR hubs/controllers, change the color of the BT hub, and change IR channels. I have lights on the second channel of each train hub so I control the motor with one channel and the light brightness with the other.|

Thanks to the [Legoino library](https://github.com/corneliusmunz/legoino) for making this a lot easier.

Maybe in the future the BT hub could support a color sensor rather than a second motor/light and set up to perform specific actions/routines when specifics colors are seen...
